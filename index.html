			<p class="bio">Caetie Ofiesh works as a product manager at the Akvo Foundation and co-director of Akvo US, where she manages the software development team and oversees the user experience, product strategy and roadmap for Akvo FLOW, a mobile and web based monitoring and evaluation tool. Akvo builds software and services that help bring greater transparency to foreign aid spending and development projects by supporting an open source and open data approach to software development and partnerships. Before joining Akvo in 2011, she developed expertise in the design, execution and management of geospatial data collection and analysis systems first as a graduate student in geography at George Washington University, and then as head of program services at Gallatin Systems, LLC. She has also directed research and policy studies at the US National Research Council and led a baseline assessment team in Malawi collecting and analyzing water and sanitation data with Water For People. Outside of work, Caetie is an avid runner and cyclist, aspiring triathlete, ambitious cook and voracious produce consumer. She works for the Farm at Sunnyside selling organic produce on the weekends at the Dupont Circle Farmers Market. She has also attended culinary school at L’Academie de Cuisine in Maryland and cooked and hosted multi-course meals for Feastly and TEDx Potomac in Washington DC. She tweets from @caetiefish and blogs about subjectively interesting maps, articles, personal essays and other web finds at caetie.com.</p>
